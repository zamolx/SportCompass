This is my proposal for the e-commerce store assignment.
 The proposal contains all mandatory requirements, plus bonus requirements 1 and 2.
I have created a main JS object (spendingCart) complemented with multiple functions such as:
- add items to cart, each item being identified by name, price and quantity;
- load, list, count, empty to display the content and the number of items in the cart, calculate total price per item and per cart, remove item(s);
